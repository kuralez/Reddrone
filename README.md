# üõ°Ô∏è Securing Autonomous Drones

A cybersecurity-focused project that explores the vulnerabilities of autonomous drones and implements mitigation strategies. This project demonstrates real-world cyberattack scenarios on drones using Wi-Fi networks, followed by recommendations for securing communication channels.

## üìö Project Overview

Autonomous drones rely heavily on wireless communication for navigation, telemetry, and control. This project identifies potential attack vectors and proposes countermeasures to improve drone cybersecurity.

- üîç Focus Areas:
  - Drone reconnaissance and traffic analysis
  - Exploitation of insecure communication protocols (e.g., MAVLink)
  - Reverse engineering mobile applications
  - Drone hijacking and video feed capture
  - MAC address spoofing for access bypass
